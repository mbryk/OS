[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

ALLISON

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

Hi.

[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE
[desperately anxious] Oh God, I'm in trouble..

(4+1) a: night ext. shot of Jerry's bldg, upper floors (a light goes on during George's first line); 1: MS on G (profile) and K (opens door); 2: MS on G, over K's sh; 3: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #2 and #3 (3[6] times); 4: L/MS of hall, G rushes toward and past cam in glee.
[At night, GEORGE is upset and knocking on Kramer's door.]
GEORGE
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!

KRAMER
[opens door] Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER
[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.
[sigh] All right.

GEORGE
[grateful, relieved] Thank you!
I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. [shuts door]

GEORGE
[delighted!] Woooo!

(4+1) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up from street level; 1: L/MS on J.Peterman and Elaine; 2: MS on E; 3: MS on JP; 2; 3; 2; 4: L/MS on both (JP in profile), zooming in for his reaction and her patting his back.
[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]

[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]
KRAMER
[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--

ALLISON
What?!

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

(1) a: ext, post-rain parking lot, ppl entering community type bldg.

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

ELAINE
She's not gonna twirl--

GEORGE
She'll Twirl.

Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?

ALLISON
[digging in purse] Yeah, uh--here. [hands him ticket]

GEORGE
Oh! Great!

ALLISON
Uh. Say, George--

GEORGE
Woo! Court side!
[mock-snide] Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

ALLISON

JERRY

GEORGE
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

[ELAINE's at the office, walking past PEGGY's office. PEGGY's reading a memo and notices her.]
PEGGY
Susie.
Susie!

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

[PEGGY feels quite threatened..]

(4+1) a: day ext. George's apt. entrance (green "321" awning); 1: full shot of George seated; 4: MS on Jerry, standing by counter in his apt. (cam. #4 from last scene); 2: MS on G; 4: (MS on J); 2; 4; 2; 3: MS from farther left; 2.
[GEORGE is in his living room, watching TV, eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches and uses the remote. The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

ELAINE
Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

PETERMAN
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

KRAMER
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

JERRY
[singing] Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

MIKE
Oh. Let me see.

[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with KRAMER.]
GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER
George, we're sorry.
[breathes in, pause] We're through..

ELAINE
[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.
What was your name again.

[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]

PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..

ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY

[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE

She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY

[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

ALLISON

Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

(K opens door revealing Mike, J is pouring juice); 4: MS on K + M; 2: MS on J; 4; 2; 4; 2; 4; 2; 3: L/MS on apt, J crosses left cam pans/tracks with them to table, cam backs up; 2: MS on K; 1: MS on J, tilts with him sitting; 3: MS on K going to door, but George is standing there; 1: (MS on J, puzzled); 2: MS on G; then alt #3 and #2 (but with one look at J [cam 1] during a long silent pause), ending with #2 (MS on G).
[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

GEORGE
[pause] What do you think, Jerry.

JERRY
[wistful] I don't know, I just see you guys together.

[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]
MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

MIKE
[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

(4+1) a: night city traffic, from street level; 1: 2S of Elaine and Jerry in car; 2: CU on Mike in dark, except for slit of light; 3: CU on E; 4: CU on J; 2; 1; 3; 4; 2: CU on M reacting during their conv. (slit of light is passing over and over his face from passing street lights); 1; 2.
[That night, ELAINE and JERRY are in the car, talking. He's driving.]
JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE
[desperately anxious] Oh God, I'm in trouble..

[At night, GEORGE is upset and knocking on Kramer's door.]
GEORGE
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!

KRAMER
[opens door] Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER
[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.
[sigh] All right.

GEORGE
[grateful, relieved] Thank you!
I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. [shuts door]

GEORGE
[delighted!] Woooo!

(4+1) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up from street level; 1: L/MS on J.Peterman and Elaine; 2: MS on E; 3: MS on JP; 2; 3; 2; 4: L/MS on both (JP in profile), zooming in for his reaction and her patting his back.
[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]

[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]
KRAMER
[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--

ALLISON
What?!

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

(1) a: ext, post-rain parking lot, ppl entering community type bldg.

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).

ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY

Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

Oh! Hadn't noticed!

Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.

Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

ELAINE
She's not gonna twirl--

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

[PEGGY feels quite threatened..]

[GEORGE is in his living room, watching TV, eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches and uses the remote. The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE
[to phone] Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. [hangs up and happily chuckles] Ha ha!

ELAINE
Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

MIKE
Oh. Let me see.

[As MIKE puts his hands there, JERRY, unaware, shuts the trunk again! It happens very fast--MIKE's hands are slammed and he screams out in pain!]

(3+1) a: night ext. rest.; 1: MS on George, over Kramer's sh (woman is in distance behind G); 2: M-CU on K, over G's rt. sh; 3: M-CU on G, over K's sh; then alt #2 and #3 for convo.; at end is 1: K just having crossed left (G dismayed, at table, the jilted woman is no longer there either).
[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with KRAMER.]
GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER
George, we're sorry.
[breathes in, pause] We're through..

GEORGE
Krama. Please.

KRAMER
[leaves, upset] Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--

ELAINE
[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.
What was your name again.

[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

GEORGE
[pause] What do you think, Jerry.

JERRY

[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]
MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

MIKE
[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

[That night, ELAINE and JERRY are in the car, talking. He's driving.]
JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER
[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.

[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

ALLISON

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

(3+1): a: daylight shot of office building, looking up at it; 1: L/MS of Peggy's office including doorway; 2: MS on Peggy; 3: MS on Elaine, cam. follows her; 2: (MS on P); 3: MS on E; 1: L/MS on both as P continues work and E reacts at doorway.
[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER

[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN

ALLISON

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

KRAMER
[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--

ALLISON
What?!

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

ELAINE
She's not gonna twirl--

GEORGE
She'll Twirl.

Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?

ALLISON
[digging in purse] Yeah, uh--here. [hands him ticket]

GEORGE
Oh! Great!

ALLISON
Uh. Say, George--

GEORGE
Woo! Court side!
[mock-snide] Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

PEGGY
Susie.
Susie!

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

[PEGGY feels quite threatened..]

[GEORGE is in his living room, watching TV, eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches and uses the remote. The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE
[to phone] Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. [hangs up and happily chuckles] Ha ha!

[At JERRY's apartment, ELAINE's just arrived.]
ELAINE
Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

KRAMER
[looking at watch] Ssssh--ah! They just closed!

Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?

PETERMAN
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

KRAMER
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.

[On the street, JERRY is leisurely unloading his groceries from the back of his car.]
JERRY
[singing] Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

MIKE
Oh. Let me see.

[As MIKE puts his hands there, JERRY, unaware, shuts the trunk again! It happens very fast--MIKE's hands are slammed and he screams out in pain!]

[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with KRAMER.]
GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER
George, we're sorry.
[breathes in, pause] We're through..

GEORGE
Krama. Please.

ELAINE
[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.
What was your name again.

[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

GEORGE
[pause] What do you think, Jerry.

JERRY

MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

Huh?

GEORGE

Oh. Oh, George.

[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..

ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE

GEORGE

Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY

[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE
[to phone] Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. [hangs up and happily chuckles] Ha ha!

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE

KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

GEORGE
[pause] What do you think, Jerry.

JERRY
[wistful] I don't know, I just see you guys together.

[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]
MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

MIKE
[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

(4+1) a: night city traffic, from street level; 1: 2S of Elaine and Jerry in car; 2: CU on Mike in dark, except for slit of light; 3: CU on E; 4: CU on J; 2; 1; 3; 4; 2: CU on M reacting during their conv. (slit of light is passing over and over his face from passing street lights); 1; 2.
[That night, ELAINE and JERRY are in the car, talking. He's driving.]
JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE
[desperately anxious] Oh God, I'm in trouble..

(4+1) a: night ext. shot of Jerry's bldg, upper floors (a light goes on during George's first line); 1: MS on G (profile) and K (opens door); 2: MS on G, over K's sh; 3: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #2 and #3 (3[6] times); 4: L/MS of hall, G rushes toward and past cam in glee.
[At night, GEORGE is upset and knocking on Kramer's door.]
GEORGE
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!

KRAMER
[opens door] Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER
[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.
[sigh] All right.

GEORGE
[grateful, relieved] Thank you!
I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. [shuts door]

GEORGE
[delighted!] Woooo!

(4+1) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up from street level; 1: L/MS on J.Peterman and Elaine; 2: MS on E; 3: MS on JP; 2; 3; 2; 4: L/MS on both (JP in profile), zooming in for his reaction and her patting his back.
[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]

[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]
KRAMER
[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--

ALLISON
What?!

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

(1) a: ext, post-rain parking lot, ppl entering community type bldg.

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

She's not gonna twirl--

Oh! Great!

ALLISON

Woo! Court side!
[mock-snide] Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

GEORGE
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

PEGGY
Susie.
Susie!

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

ELAINE
Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

JERRY
[singing] Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with KRAMER.]
GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER
George, we're sorry.

[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.

KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE

Jerry--

[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.

Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE

She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE

ALLISON

Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

[PETERMAN and PEGGY are sitting in his office. There are two empty chairs. The window overlooks central park.]
ELAINE
[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.
What was your name again.

[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

GEORGE
[pause] What do you think, Jerry.

JERRY

[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]
MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

MIKE
[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

[That night, ELAINE and JERRY are in the car, talking. He's driving.]
JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

ALLISON

He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

ELAINE
She's not gonna twirl--

GEORGE
She'll Twirl.

Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY

And she wants to break up with you..

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE

Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

Hi.

[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

ELAINE
She's not gonna twirl--

GEORGE
She'll Twirl.

Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?

ALLISON
[digging in purse] Yeah, uh--here. [hands him ticket]

GEORGE
Oh! Great!

ALLISON
Uh. Say, George--

GEORGE
Woo! Court side!
[mock-snide] Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

PEGGY
Susie.
Susie!

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

[PEGGY feels quite threatened..]

[GEORGE is in his living room, watching TV, eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches and uses the remote. The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE
[to phone] Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. [hangs up and happily chuckles] Ha ha!

[At JERRY's apartment, ELAINE's just arrived.]
ELAINE
Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

KRAMER
[looking at watch] Ssssh--ah! They just closed!

JERRY
[not] Oh. Too Bad.

[PETERMAN's office. ELAINE comes to the door.]
ELAINE
Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?

PETERMAN
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN

KRAMER
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON

[On the street, JERRY is leisurely unloading his groceries from the back of his car.]
JERRY
[singing] Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

MIKE
Oh. Let me see.

[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with KRAMER.]
GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER
George, we're sorry.
[breathes in, pause] We're through..

Krama. Please.

[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.
What was your name again.

KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]

Oh. Oh, George.

[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..

ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE

[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

ALLISON

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

JERRY

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE

Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE

What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE

[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE
[desperately anxious] Oh God, I'm in trouble..

[At night, GEORGE is upset and knocking on Kramer's door.]
GEORGE
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!

KRAMER
[opens door] Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER
[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.
[sigh] All right.

GEORGE
[grateful, relieved] Thank you!
I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. [shuts door]

GEORGE
[delighted!] Woooo!

(4+1) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up from street level; 1: L/MS on J.Peterman and Elaine; 2: MS on E; 3: MS on JP; 2; 3; 2; 4: L/MS on both (JP in profile), zooming in for his reaction and her patting his back.
[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]

[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]
KRAMER
[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--

ALLISON
What?!

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

(1) a: ext, post-rain parking lot, ppl entering community type bldg.

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).
[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]
ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY
You taking Allison?

GEORGE
Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

JERRY
Live?

ELAINE
Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

GEORGE
Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.

ELAINE
She's not gonna twirl--

GEORGE
She'll Twirl.

GEORGE
Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?

ALLISON
[digging in purse] Yeah, uh--here. [hands him ticket]

GEORGE
Oh! Great!

ALLISON
Uh. Say, George--

GEORGE
Woo! Court side!
[mock-snide] Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

ALLISON

JERRY
She wants to talk.

GEORGE
She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

[ELAINE's at the office, walking past PEGGY's office. PEGGY's reading a memo and notices her.]
PEGGY
Susie.
Susie!

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

[PEGGY feels quite threatened..]

(4+1) a: day ext. George's apt. entrance (green "321" awning); 1: full shot of George seated; 4: MS on Jerry, standing by counter in his apt. (cam. #4 from last scene); 2: MS on G; 4: (MS on J); 2; 4; 2; 3: MS from farther left; 2.
[GEORGE is in his living room, watching TV, eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches and uses the remote. The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

ELAINE
Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

PETERMAN
Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

KRAMER
Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

JERRY
[singing] Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

MIKE
Oh. Let me see.

[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with KRAMER.]
GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

KRAMER
George, we're sorry.
[breathes in, pause] We're through..

ELAINE
[entering, uneasy] Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. [sits]

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

PETERMAN
She is The Best.
What was your name again.

[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]

PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..

ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY

[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE

She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY

[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

ALLISON

Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

(K opens door revealing Mike, J is pouring juice); 4: MS on K + M; 2: MS on J; 4; 2; 4; 2; 4; 2; 3: L/MS on apt, J crosses left cam pans/tracks with them to table, cam backs up; 2: MS on K; 1: MS on J, tilts with him sitting; 3: MS on K going to door, but George is standing there; 1: (MS on J, puzzled); 2: MS on G; then alt #3 and #2 (but with one look at J [cam 1] during a long silent pause), ending with #2 (MS on G).
[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]
KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.

KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

GEORGE
[pause] What do you think, Jerry.

JERRY
[wistful] I don't know, I just see you guys together.

[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]
MIKE
Thumbs!

[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]

MIKE
[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

(4+1) a: night city traffic, from street level; 1: 2S of Elaine and Jerry in car; 2: CU on Mike in dark, except for slit of light; 3: CU on E; 4: CU on J; 2; 1; 3; 4; 2: CU on M reacting during their conv. (slit of light is passing over and over his face from passing street lights); 1; 2.
[That night, ELAINE and JERRY are in the car, talking. He's driving.]
JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!

ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.

JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.

(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?

JERRY
What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE
I kinda like her.

JERRY
She's Gooone.

ELAINE
Jerry--

JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]

MIKE
[desperately anxious] Oh God, I'm in trouble..

[At night, GEORGE is upset and knocking on Kramer's door.]
GEORGE
Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!

KRAMER
[opens door] Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..

GEORGE
[sad] It's only four..

KRAMER
Huh?

GEORGE
I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--

KRAMER
Oh. Oh, George.

GEORGE
Please. Give me another chance.

KRAMER
[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this.
[sigh] All right.

GEORGE
[grateful, relieved] Thank you!
I'm gonna make you both so happy!

KRAMER
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. [shuts door]

GEORGE
[delighted!] Woooo!

(4+1) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up from street level; 1: L/MS on J.Peterman and Elaine; 2: MS on E; 3: MS on JP; 2; 3; 2; 4: L/MS on both (JP in profile), zooming in for his reaction and her patting his back.
[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.

PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.

ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]

[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]
KRAMER
[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--

ALLISON
What?!

KRAMER
He's gonna make us very happy.

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]

(1) a: ext, post-rain parking lot, ppl entering community type bldg.

[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]
ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.

JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..

ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.

[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]

PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.

JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.

[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

ELAINE
What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]

(3+3) a: ext. small wet parking lot, red convertible is parking; 1: MS on JP pulling up; b: MS on bumpers bumping (hood pops up); 2: MS on JP getting out, tilts and pans with him, but stops to tilt and focus on the hood; 3: MS on M getting out, pans rt. with him (sign in bg); c: MS on sign; 3: (M reacts).
[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big. PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick in, white, letters):

        TODAY'S
        SCHEDULE

  LEIBERMAN BARMITZVAH  
          <--


    SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
          -->


 
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

(7+1) a: Tavern on the Green at dusk (roof lines and bare tree are lit up); 1: full shot of G + K; 2: MS on K; 3: MS on G, over K's sh; 2: MS on K, over G's rt. sh; then alts #3 and #2; 4: 2S as K passes G; 2: now MS on K, over G's sh; 3: MS on G (he's pulling K back); 2; 3; 4; 5: full shot in ballroom as K spins in, pans with him to Wilhelm and group; 6: MS on W; 7: 2S on K + G, over W's rt. sh; 6; 7.
[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]
[Commercial Break]
(4+2) a: day ext. of office bldg, looking up at it from street level; 1: MS on JP and E seated (JP in profile); 2: MS on JP (dark window in bg); 3: MS on E; 2: (pan with his leaning forward, becomes over her sh); 3: MS on E, over JP's rt. sh; 4: full shot on JP + E, tilts up and pans with him leaving, but stops, tilts down to E; b: directly overhead shot of E, spins CCW and backing up.
[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]

[JERRY and ELAINE walking down the street. ELAINE is carrying two plastic grocery bags and one big paper grocery bag. JERRY is carrying none and is pretending to not notice the discrepancy.]
JERRY
Good shave today..

ELAINE
[wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.

JERRY
I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..

ELAINE
Can we rest here a second.

JERRY
[pause] Yeah, I guess.

[She sits on the stairs of a small entryway.]

JERRY
.. So how's Noreen?

ELAINE
Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.

JERRY
Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..

ELAINE
No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya haveta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.

JERRY
A Long Talker.

ELAINE
Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.

JERRY
[pause] All right; let's move it out.

[ELAINE gathers her bags.]

JERRY
Hey, isn't that George's father?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?

JERRY
I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.

ELAINE
That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?

JERRY
I believe he is wearing a cape.

ELAINE
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?

JERRY
Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.

ELAINE
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?

JERRY
You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.

[ELAINE positions the bags to cover her face and upper body. JERRY walks by her so he's out of view, too.]

[End of Intro-- time: 1:23]
[Commercial Break]
[JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's "house."]
JERRY
Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.

[ELAINE drops one bag deliberately and throws the others on the counter. He hadn't helped her at all on the way -- pay back time. Then, during the following, she spends a lot of time looking for food in the bags and puts some in one bag--presumably hers.]

JERRY
Oh! I got a message. [presses button on phone machine]

GEORGE
[on tape] Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say.. [beeeep]

ELAINE
That sounds Urgent..

JERRY
Let me call him back.. 
Hello?? Who is this?
Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.

ELAINE
Donna Chang?

JERRY
[is re-dialing] Should 'ave talked to her; I love Chinese women.

ELAINE
Isn't that a little racist?

JERRY
If I like their race, how can that be racist?..
Hellooo??..
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..
Yyy-yes, I am calling George.. 
Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his caaalls. Well, what do you know?!

[KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle of water. JERRY stays on the line to chat with Donna.]

JERRY
So listen..

KRAMER
I'm goin' through this stuff like water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin' to?

ELAINE
He's on with a Chinese woman.

KRAMER
Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling down his underwear in back, through his pants]

ELAINE
You got a.. comfort problem there?

KRAMER
Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

ELAINE
I thought you wore silk underwear.

KRAMER
Nno. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up.] My boys need a house.

ELAINE
[not charmed..] That's nice. 
Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.

KRAMER
Sperm count?
Well how many ssssperm should I have?

ELAINE
A lot.

[JERRY comes back. He'd wandered into the bedroom and is now off the phone.]

JERRY
I got a date!

ELAINE
With the Chinese woman?!

JERRY
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.

KRAMER
Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?

JERRY
No, why should I? I wear boxers.

KRAMER
You ever get a woman pregnant.

JERRY
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..

KRAMER
What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?

JERRY
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..

Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--

KRAMER
A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked out]

Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!

JERRY
Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.

KRAMER
Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!

JERRY
Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.

KRAMER
Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle of the day??

ELAINE
Does that conflict with your regular schedule?..

[KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]

ELAINE
[going to the phone, she's been eating chips from small package of them] All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.

JERRY
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!

ELAINE
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?

JERRY
She suggested it!

ELAINE
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..

JERRY
She's very assimilated.

[ELAINE's on the phone--we hear a male, "Hello?" on the other end. ELAINE quickly hangs up.]

JERRY
Paul again?

ELAINE
[matter of fact] You can't get one ring past him.

[GEORGE comes in.]

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!

JERRY
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!

GEORGE
Uh?

ELAINE
[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.

GEORGE
What's he doin' in the city today?

[They both shrug.]

GEORGE
You didn't ask him?

[They both shake heads no. ELAINE's eating chips.]

GEORGE
You didn't say hello?

ELAINE
Well, he was with someone.
A man.. In a cape.

GEORGE
Why was he wearing a cape?..

[ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]

GEORGE
Was my father wearing a cape?

JERRY
No. Jacket and tie: no cape.

GEORGE
Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes to door] W--a man with a cape doin' with my father?..What was my father doing with a man in a cape? .. [opens door] Why a cape? [out the door and gone]

[Fertility clinic. In an examination room. KRAMER's waiting. The DOCTOR comes in.]
DOCTOR
The results of your sperm test are in.
Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?

KRAMER
Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...

DOCTOR
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.

KRAMER
Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate! I--

DOCTOR
Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.

KRAMER
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.

DOCTOR
First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.

KRAMER
All the time?

DOCTOR
All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.

KRAMER
Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.

[At ELAINE's. She's in her robe and talking on the phone, blowing a hair dryer onto the phone.]
ELAINE
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'--

Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..

Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..

[a little later, is sitting] Yeah, I took 20%, too..

Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car.. seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the phone. [hangs up]

[Night. The Hunan Balcony. JERRY's in the waiting area, in a good mood, sitting next to a GUY.]
HOSTESS
Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.

JERRY
Yes, I will.

GUY
[indicating a cigarette] Mind?

JERRY
[good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.

[DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not Asian. But is good-looking.]

DONNA
Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] 'scuse me?

DONNA
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Who're you?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang..

JERRY
[stands, in shock, it's not sinking in] What do you mean?

DONNA
I mean: I'm Donna Chang.

JERRY
[pause] You're Donna Chang?

DONNA
Did you think I was Chinese?..

JERRY
Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?

DONNA
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.

JERRY
I didn't think so.

DONNA
It used to be "Changstein."

[Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY. She's making herself a bowl of Raisin Bran.]
ELAINE
She's not Chinese?

JERRY
No. Not Chinese.
Not even Asian.

ELAINE
So. What is she?

JERRY
Well, she's.. like you.

ELAINE
[pause] Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been. [walks to couch, with her cereal]

JERRY
Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..

ELAINE
So why're you seeing her again..

JERRY
Well, she is a woman.

ELAINE
I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Well, maybe.

JERRY
[sits on couch as something occurs to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?

ELAINE
[pause] What do you mean?

JERRY
Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?

[As ELAINE considers the implications, KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile of underwear in his hands.]

KRAMER
Here. Take my Jockey shorts.

[JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following him as JERRY walks backward around the apartment during the following.]

ELAINE
Whoa! Whoa!

JERRY
What is that?!!

KRAMER
Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.

JERRY
Wha--you have a low sperm count?

KRAMER
Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.

JERRY
Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.

KRAMER
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!

JERRY
Look! I don't want 'em!

KRAMER
All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!

JERRY
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!

[KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's table and is grabbing at his own pants.]

KRAMER
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!

[ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]

KRAMER
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]

JERRY 
[calmly turns back to The Pile on his table] Well. I'm gonna have to move now.

[At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER at a booth.]
FRANK
Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.

GEORGE
Plenty of mosquitoes.

FRANK
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

GEORGE
So, Dad..

FRANK
Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.

GEORGE
Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!

FRANK
Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?

GEORGE
No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.

FRANK
They didn't say hello?

GEORGE
Well, they were in a rush.

FRANK
They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.

GEORGE
They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.

FRANK
Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--supercilious.

GEORGE
So Dad.

FRANK
How could Jerry not say Hello?!!

[Night. At JERRY's with he and DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch and he's drying the dishes. She's just hung up the phone.]
JERRY
So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?

DONNA
No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.

JERRY
[long pause--did he hear "ridicurous"--should he say something--can't decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?

DONNA
Ridiculous.

JERRY
[pause] I thought you said.. "ridicurous." [he and she look at each other, puzzled.]

[GEORGE comes in.]

JERRY
Oh, what are you doing here?

GEORGE
Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA] talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you had company. [JERRY indicates he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.

DONNA
Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself registers that as weird, is heading to the kitchen.]

I just spoke to your mother before.

GEORGE
[pause] You spoke to my mother?

DONNA
She was trying to call you, but--

JERRY
The rines were crossed?

[They both look at him weird.]

GEORGE
Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"

JERRY
Did I?

DONNA
[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?

DONNA
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.

[JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE immediately and ritually goes to the oven, turns on the gas, opens the door and sticks his head in it.]

[End of Act I-- time: 10:18]
[Commercial Break]
[Same night, at JERRY's apartment--Donna's left. ELAINE's there.]
ELAINE
Divorced. That's really too bad..

JERRY
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.

GEORGE
[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!

JERRY
I never thought of that.

GEORGE
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha! It's like runnin' the double marathon!

ELAINE
Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?

JERRY
Have you ever spent any time with these people..?

GEORGE
You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this!

I don't trust men in capes.

JERRY
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.

GEORGE
All right Superman's the exception.

ELAINE
[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]

[KRAMER enters.]

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. [to JERRY] I've always had a thing for Noreen.

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.

KRAMER
Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. [walking around at ease, some dancey moves]

JERRY
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..

KRAMER
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.

JERRY
You went back to the Jockeys?

KRAMER
Wrong again.

JERRY
[pause] Oh, no..

ELAINE
What? What?..

JERRY
Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..

ELAINE
Eeaawww...

JERRY
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..

JERRY
Kramer, say it isn't so.

KRAMER
Oh, it be so.

I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllooovin' every minute of it!!!

JERRY
Don't you need a little.. help?

KRAMER
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave, still very happy, then:] I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!!

[Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN are sitting at the counter. We're looking straight at them.]
ELAINE
Well, you guys are tryin' to work it ouut! That's great!..

NOREEN
Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..

ELAINE
Oh, he went insane?..

NOREEN
Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?

ELAINE
[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna, talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!

NOREEN
[has been growing increasingly slack jawed in amazement] I can't believe that was you..

ELAINE
[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..

NOREEN
[pause] So you thought he was boring?

ELAINE
Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.

NOREEN
[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!

ELAINE
I know--

JERRY
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.

ELAINE
Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.

JERRY
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.

ELAINE
[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.

JERRY
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman! Anything you say she does!

[Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over, hits the button.]

JERRY
Yeah.

DONNA
It's Donna Chang.

JERRY
[hits button] Come on up.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..

JERRY
Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay..

JERRY
First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.

ELAINE
She was lost..

JERRY
Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!

ELAINE
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..

JERRY
You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Briidge..

ELAINE
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!

[DONNA CHANG comes in briskly, good mood.]

DONNA
Hi.

JERRY
Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..

[At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE: Hi! Good to meet you.]

DONNA
[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.

JERRY
Why? What happened?

DONNA
Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour, she changed her mind!!!

JERRY
Wow! That's amazing!

DONNA
Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said you should come too.

JERRY
Tonight?

DONNA
Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. [goes to phone]

[Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly exchange looks.]

[Same day. At the Costanzas', are GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE just entered. ESTELLE's snacking watching TV.]
GEORGE
All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin' to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your miinds!!!

ESTELLE
[calmly] We're not getting divorced.

FRANK
You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]

GEORGE
[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear that.

FRANK
Yeah. We worked it out.

GEORGE
All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?

FRANK
He was my lawyer.

GEORGE
You lawyer wears a cape..?

FRANK
Yeah. So what?

GEORGE
Who wears a cape?

FRANK
He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.

ESTELLE
He looks ridiculous in that thing..

FRANK
You have no eye for fashion!!!

ESTELLE
I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!

GEORGE
All right! Come on! 
Let's not fight.

FRANK and ESTELLE
All right! All right!

ESTELLE
Georgie's right.

GEORGE
So what made you change your mind?

ESTELLE
It was that Chinese woman.

[In Jerry's car. JERRY's driving, DONNA CHANG is with him.]
JERRY
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?

DONNA
I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.

JERRY
[pause] Confucius, huh?

DONNA
Yeah.

JERRY
[pause] You know, you're not Chinese..

[The Costanzas' again. They open the door for JERRY and DONNA.]
JERRY
Hey! I heard the good news!

FRANK
Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!

JERRY
Elaine was.. in a rush.

FRANK
I knew it was Elaine!!

DONNA
You must be Estelle.

ESTELLE
Yes. Who are you..?

DONNA
I'm Donna Chang!

ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!

[Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment. NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on the couch when the phone rings. KRAMER picks it up. Scene cuts back and forth between ELAINE and them.]
KRAMER
YHello?

ELAINE
Paul?

KRAMER
Elaine!

ELAINE
Kramer?

KRAMER
[pause] Yeahh!

ELAINE
What're you doin' there?

KRAMER
Wellll, isn't it obvious?

ELAINE
Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?

KRAMER
Yes, she is..

ELAINE
Well? Can I talk to her?

KRAMER
What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?

ELAINE
[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?..

KRAMER
Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..

ELAINE
You feel?

KRAMER
That's right!
She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

ELAINE
What are you insane?!

KRAMER
From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..

ELAINE
Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?

KRAMER
Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now.. And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

ELAINE
Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!

KRAMER
Can't help ya, kid.

[Back at the Costanzas'. Still daylight.]
ESTELLE
You're not Chinese!?!?

DONNA
[pause] No.

ESTELLE
I thought you were Chinese!!

DONNA
I'm from Long Island.

ESTELLE
Long Island?!?!
I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!

DONNA
I'm sorry..?

ESTELLE
Well! Then, that changes everything!

GEORGE
What?!

ESTELLE
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!

GEORGE
So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!

ESTELLE
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into kitchen]

GEORGE
[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!

FRANK
[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!

JERRY
[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name..

[Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking down the street.]
ELAINE
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!

JERRY
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.

ELAINE
[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. 
I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.

JERRY
[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish..

[A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets out.]

GEORGE
Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]

Saw both of them today!
What a disaster!
I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this!

[KRAMER sticks his head out of his (or Jerry's) apartment window, shouts down to them.]

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live ooon! Noreen's late! She's laaate!!

[End of Act II time: 9:18]
[Commercial Break]
[During credit roll. Night on the Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over the edge, the wind blowing up on her face. Then a man in a black cape edges over to her cautiously, reaches and holds her forearm.]
NOREEN
Who are you?!

MAN
[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get back off (and out of view of the camera).]

[The End-- Total transcript time: 21:22]

[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[time: 00:43]
[Commercial Break]
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.

[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!

[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]

MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]

[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--

[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.

It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancé..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been insi-ide in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.

[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancé, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.

[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]

MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.

MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}

MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!

[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]

[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!

[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]

[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY
She had Man hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!

[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.

Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man KRAMER:
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).

Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF type of restaurant.]

[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.

[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a good-bye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?

[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]

[Exterior of cheap looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!

[Three female MODELS come up to them.]

MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modeling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?

MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancé, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. [shows them the picture]

MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Exterior of a restaurant.]
[Close-up of GILLIAN's Man hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]
GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] Oh. Twist off..

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]

[A close-up of his face while a Man hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?

[Closeup of her Man hands tearing open a lobster.]

[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!

[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"

[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[time: 10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!

[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?

[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!

[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffee shop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.

Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!

[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow dryer together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE
Hello? 
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]

[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!

[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of Man hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!

[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a Man hand grabs his arm] Uh!

[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]

You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffee shop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!

[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of Man hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!

[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.

[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly creeped out] This is really weird..

[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!

[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are companionably giving a beggar money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.

[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..

[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]

[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.

[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE
Hi. George.

MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, back when it was a meat packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. [hands her a magazine page]

MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?

MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.

[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]

[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right]

[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..

[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.

[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..

[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ball game this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Heyy, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]

[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?

GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?

[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..

[The meat packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.]
JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.

[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[time: 10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny, Brady Bunch-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a pay phone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.

[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.

[They have a long smarmy group hug.]

KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.

[time: 00:44; total time: 22:51]
[The End]

[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]
KRAMER
Look how dark it's gettin' already.

JERRY
Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.

KRAMER
When does it start?

JERRY
[pause] I don't know, they just tell you the night before.

KRAMER
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. [pulls out his pocket watch (it has a chain, too)]
I am springin' ahead riiight now.

JERRY
[under breath] Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

JERRY
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..

KRAMER
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!

JERRY
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.

KRAMER
Hey! Mike!

MIKE
[sees and is enthused, coming over] Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!

JERRY
Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..

MIKE
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

JERRY
No openings in arson?

MIKE
[pauses, struck by J's attitude] Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy.

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

JERRY
I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. [casually leaves]

MIKE
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?

KRAMER
You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.

MIKE
Hey, what time you got?

KRAMER
[pulling out his timepiece] Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.

MIKE
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. [leaves]

[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]
ELAINE
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.

ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.

PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]

(3+1): a: Monk's at night: the "RESTAURANT" sign; 1: MS on Elaine, over Jerry's rt. sh.; 2: on J over E's sh.; 3: (when George comes over) L/MS over J's rt. sh, cam. trucks left; 2: (briefly); 3: (now a 3-shot); 1: 2S on G + E, over J's rt. sh.; then alt. 2 and 1, only going to 2 (Jerry) briefly (alts 4 times).

ELAINE
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."

JERRY
I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.

ELAINE
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?

JERRY
Who are you describing?

ELAINE
Someone I know.

JERRY
Named Sharon?

ELAINE
I'd rather not say.

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
[to say hello] Mmm!
What's in the bag?

GEORGE
[sitting] Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!

JERRY
Kind of a Yankee prom?

GEORGE
[resentfully dampened] It's not a prom. It's a Ball.

JERRY

Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--

Lithe.

GEORGE
Live?

ELAINE
[rolling her eyes] Lithe!

JERRY
Oh, lithe!

ELAINE
Well, you two'll have a great time there.

JERRY
It can't be worse than this.

ELAINE
Mmm!

GEORGE
An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!

ELAINE
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?

JERRY
Nobody needs to talk.

GEORGE
Who would Want to.
She tried to end it with me, Jerry.

JERRY
What'd ya do?

GEORGE
I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.

JERRY
[pause] All night?!

GEORGE
Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

JERRY
And she wants to break up with you..

GEORGE
Ha! [snort] Can you believe it? [amused] I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.

JERRY
Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."

GEORGE
So? What'm I gonna do?

JERRY
You really like this girl.

GEORGE
No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!

JERRY
You've made some Fine Exits.

GEORGE
[admitting] All right..

JERRY
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.

GEORGE
[resolved] Why not.
[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.

KRAMER
[suddenly entering] Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, right here. [hands it to him]

KRAMER
All right! Yeah.. Court side.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..

GEORGE
[clipping on shades] Ha.. She'll have to find me first. [leaving]

KRAMER
{All right.} [to JERRY] Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars.

JERRY
What for?

KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."

KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

JERRY
So you put down my money?!

KRAMER
[impatient sigh] You don't have a problem.

JERRY
Not {with} that, no..

ELAINE
[coming in] Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--

PEGGY
Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah. See that--

PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

PEGGY
I heard she was a disaster, Suze--

ELAINE
[testy, leans into Peggy's personal space] Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-sie. My name, is Su-sie!

The machine tape is to the tune of the Greatest American Hero theme song ("The Greatest American Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.

GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.

JERRY
So, coffee shop?

GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]

GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]

(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomimes shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]

[GEORGE dials a number.]

GEORGE

Can you believe this woman?

JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!

ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Susie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.

JERRY
No. No Suze.

ELAINE
[tense] I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Back seat Bimbo?!

JERRY
Who are you describin'?

ELAINE
Someone I know!

JERRY
Named Suze?

ELAINE
No, still Sharon!

KRAMER
[comes in, subdued] Hey. [grabs a water from refrigerator]

JERRY
Hey, I thought you went to the game.

KRAMER
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. [leaving]

JERRY
Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!

KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.

ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?

KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]

JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]

ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--

JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!

KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hot-dog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.

ELAINE
So that's it?

KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]

JERRY
Can you believe that?

ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.

KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!

JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!

KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!

JERRY
On what?!

KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. [getting out pocket watch]

JERRY
Yeah, all right.

Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"?

ELAINE
Su-sie?

PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

ELAINE
[nit] It's Susie.

PETERMAN
Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office.

Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

ALLISON
Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?

MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.

JERRY
Why not?

MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..

JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?

MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!

JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.

MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?

[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She cries..]

KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.

GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.

KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.

GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?

KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!

GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!

KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]

GEORGE
[pause] Are you?

KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.

GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

PETERMAN
Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.

ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--

PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.

PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.

ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--

PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]

ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.

PETERMAN
Who.

ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?

PETERMAN
Where is she?!

ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!

PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.

ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!

PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

ELAINE
[feigning hearing something] What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. [rushes out!]

KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.

JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?

KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.

JERRY
Why is he scared.

KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

JERRY
Yeah, but--

KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.

JERRY
It was an accident.

KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?

MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!

JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.

KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.

JERRY
[whatever] Fine..

MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!

[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]

KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.

JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.

[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]

GEORGE
Hi.

KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.

[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]

GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.

Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..

GEORGE
[embarrassed, self conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..

You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--

What?

(Meanwhile, MIKE is now hoarse, is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.

ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!

JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
[firmly matter of fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.

ELAINE

ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.

PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.

Oh! Hadn't noticed!

Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.

GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..

KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.

GEORGE
But you took me back.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]

GEORGE
Where are you goin'..

KRAMER
The Ball, silly.

GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.

KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.

GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.

KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..

[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too much attention.]

GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well received by WILHELM!]

WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.

WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.

PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.

ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]

PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.

And it was Pretty Good.

JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]

[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]

PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!

[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]

JERRY
[smugly, under his breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

[time: 09:27]

[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..

PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.

[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]

ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!

[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

[JERRY's run into TIA at Calvin Klein, where he's waiting for Kramer.]
TIA
Well--what're you doing here.

JERRY
Well, I had to talk to you--I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.

TIA
Well; I've been busy.

JERRY
Because I--I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me [amused and flustered, indicates a nose pick]..

TIA
[waving him off] I'd rather not talk about this--

JERRY
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.

TIA
I know what I saw. [turns toward the elevators]

JERRY
But there--but there was no piick!! I--I did not pick!! There was no piick!!

TIA
I gotta go. [walks briskly]

JERRY
No! No piick!

[KRAMER's gotten a meeting with Calvin Klein. They're in CK's big office. CK is sitting on a sectional couch and KRAMER's standing.]
KRAMER
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.

CK
Interesting face.

KRAMER
Yeah--And um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know he--he laughed at me.

CK
You're very lithe, aren't you: very graceful.

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

CK
Sit down; eh?

KRAMER
[ungracefully sits, misjudging the one side of this sectional couch]

CK
You're very lean, but muscular.

KRAMER
You know, I try to take care of myself, I--I watch what I eat. Ah! Just recently I cut out fructose.

CK
You're Spectacular.

KRAMER
[flattered] Oh.

[Elaine's office. ELAINE at her desk, FRED (the religious boyfriend) is standing, visiting.]
ELAINE
I told you, Fred: my friend's next door neighbor took it.

FRED
[incredulous] Sooo--what happened.

ELAINE
Well, I--I--I must a missed a button, I forgot to button it.

FRED
I really don't see how you could misss a button like that.

ELAINE
Oh, you've never missed a button? [her phone rings, she pushes a button] Yeah?..

RECEPTIONIST
[on speaker] Your sister, Gail.

ELAINE
Oh, God--my nephew. [picks up receiver and hits button] Hi Gail!.. Yu--yu--Yes, Gail; I know how old he is.

CO-WORKER
[peeks head in doorway] Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?

ELAINE
Yeah, take it! Take it!--An' stop calling me "Nip"!

CO-WORKER
[takes it and flees]

ELAINE
[back on the phone] It was an accident!

Well--well--it's gotta be somewhere; look under his mattress.

[fifteen seconds--a wordless scene--probably GEORGE going up the stairs to SUSAN's apartment, feeling like he's going to his execution while she's mellow and happy.]
[CK's office. Now Kramer's gone and a couple of other people are there sitting on the couch talking with CK.]
WOMAN
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point-- [sees KRAMER, prospective model; KRAMER's only wearing dress shoes, white socks, and white briefs; he's strutting his stuff]--My. He's Sexual, athletic--an' without a trace of self-consciousness!

CK
His buttocks are sublime!

MAN
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work--I suppose we could get him into the weight room--

WOMAN
[entranced] No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.

KRAMER
[puts hand on wall to affect a casual lean on it but the corner there is rounded; he slides and falls down--but maintains his cool throughout]

[The other people don't notice, are talking amongst themselves.]

MAN
You've done it again, CK!

[Out in the hall, TIA and others are waiting for the elevators and JERRY makes a stand.]
JERRY
[nobly announcing] An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. [elevator arrives] Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame an' humiliation because of People Like You.. [she's in elevator with others, and she clearly can't wait for the doors to shut--JERRY stays in the hall] Are we not human! If we pick do we not bleed! [elevator doors have shut and the few people in the hall are looking at him] I am not an Animal!

[At Elaine's office, ELAINE'S standing at doorway challenging FRED. He's shocked by her speech and flees after the first part--then she calls after him, staying where she is.]
ELAINE
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you: I wish now that I had: Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!

[time: 3:26]
